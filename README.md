# MCBE Documentation
An attempt to create a better & reliable MCBE addon documentation which is easy to parse and offers everything the default vanilla documentation offers. This project is a heavy WIP.

### Adding a new component
The documentation data can be found inside the "documentation" folder of this repository.
#### (1) Modify ```components.json```
Add the new component to the ```components.json``` file. You must define both: name & path to the component file.

#### (2) Add the component
Take a look at the file ```example.json``` to see how to build a component page.
