# MCBE Documentation
An attempt to create a better & reliable MCBE addon documentation which is easy to parse and offers everything the default vanilla documentation offers. This project is a heavy WIP.

## To-dos:
- recognizing patterns to remove redundancies
- better values for boolean types
- filters to correct mistakes in the vanilla files
- only push the same string once
- mapping vanilla descriptions onto the new documentation
